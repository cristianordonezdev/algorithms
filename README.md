# ðŸ§  C# Algorithms Practice

This repository contains solutions to various algorithmic problems solved in **C#**, as part of my learning journey and efforts to improve problem-solving skills in the language.  
Most of the exercises come from **LeetCode** or **HackerRank**.

## ðŸ“Œ Goal

To strengthen my skills in C#, especially in:

- Data structures (`HashSet`, `List`, `Dictionary`, etc.)
- Problem-solving techniques (sliding window, recursion, binary search, etc.)
- Algorithmic thinking and performance optimization

Each file contains a self-contained solution to a problem, written with clean and well-commented code to make it easier to understand.

## âœ… Solved Problems So Far

- [x] Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
- [x] Two Sum
